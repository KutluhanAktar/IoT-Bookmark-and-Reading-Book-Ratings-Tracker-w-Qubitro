> I recently developed my portfolio website — kutluhanaktar.com — from scratch and decided to migrate all of my codebase to GitHub to provide a simple and straightforward experimentation or replication method for my proof-of-concept projects. Nonetheless, since I focused on demonstrating my thought process and experiment results thoroughly in the written tutorial format, including but not limited to PCB and 3D model designing steps, I could not provide enough information to fully explain my concepts and instructions via GitHub descriptions only. Thus, I highly recommend inspecting the associated project tutorials and videos on my portfolio website or other platforms (maker communities), i.e., Hackster, Hackaday, and Instructables.
